            <h1>CARP Task</h1>
            <p>Here are the Bristol Balloon Fiesta posters I designed.</p>
            <p class="carp-intro">This was my first design for the Bristol balloon fiesta. Itâ€™s the task I spent the most time on it because I had no idea how and what to design a poster at the beginning. I did lots of research on designing a poster. I used google to find different kinds of posters to draw some inspiration.  Besides, I have learned the basics of using Adobe InDesign while designing the poster as It is my first time using Adobe InDesign. I learned it from google and YouTube too.</p>

            <div class="poster_items1">
                <img class="padded-carp" src="carp/CARP poster version 1.jpg" targest="blank" width="49%" height="79%"
                    alt="CARP TASK">
                <p class="carp-p">In my first design, you can see a painting of the sky in the background and I put a hot air balloon in the centre of the whole page because it is the main object that I want people to notice when they see this poster. The name of the festival is on top of the balloon. The information and the sponsor are at the bottom.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="poster_items2">
                <img class="padded-carp" src="carp/CARP poster version 2.jpg" targest="blank" width="49%" height="79%"
                    alt="CARP TASK">
                    <p class="carp-p">In my second design, you can see the style of it is totally different from the first one. I used two triangles to make some layers on the bottom and add a rectangular strip that paralleled the triangle on the bottom right. On the top, I used one of the images that I took in Clifton bridge. I think it is beautiful and suitable for my poster, especially the sunset. Then, I put the name of the festival on the top left. Sponsors are inside the triangle on the bottom left and information is on the bottom right.</p>

            <div class="poster_items1">
                <img class="padded-carp" src="carp/CARP poster version 3.jpg" targest="blank" width="49%" height="79%"
                    alt="CARP TASK">
                <p class="carp-p">In my third design, I also put the balloon in the centre of the poster, but the balloon is way bigger than the first one. I put most of the things inside the balloon. The name of the festival, information and sponsors.  I only put the date and the cost on the bottom left and make it black because it is a piece of important information.</p>
