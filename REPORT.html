            <p class="report-p">At the beginning of the course, I was excited about what I am going to do. I was told I must submit four tasks for the first semester: CARP tasks, typography, worksheet and my own website. I was nervous because of my inexperience in using those designing software. I knew I must put more effort into learning those things. After a few weeks of lectures, I was getting started on my assignment. I started with my CARP tasks and typography as I need more time on learning how to use the software from the basics. Following these were the worksheet and my website.</p>
            <p class="report-p">For my first task, I spent the most time designing the posters. I had no idea what I should do. I spent a week only searching for posters from other people on google and YouTube and my brain is blank. I knew it is not going to work and I tried to work on the software. It was tough for me to start with nothing. Learning about using this software was the most challenging thing in this task. But I still got it. After that, I did see some progression in the task. I did my first poster finally and the following posters were doing well because I already learn the basics. To be honest, I am really satisfied with what I did.</p>
            <p class="report-p">After the CARP task, it was much easier for me to do the typography task. It didn’t take me much time. I only had to create eight sketches with the following typographic systems. I followed the rules of each typographic system and design it to the topic given by the guiding worksheet on the blackboard. I just kept everything simple and showed my understanding of each typographic system.</p>
            <p class="report-p">Working on the worksheet reminded me the memory of the basics of HTML. Before I came here, I learned some HTML code in my computer lesson at my secondary school when I was studying in Hong Kong, but I never use it. I followed what Mary said on the worksheets and I kept following what the task told me to do. As I said, I learn HTML before, but I had never learned CSS. I learned how to style my HTML with the CSS sheet and I found it quite useful because it helped me to understand how I can use CSS to style it and make the website exactly what I want.</p>
            <p class="report-p">Lastly was my personal website. After the coding worksheet, I was familiar with building up a website, at least a basic website. Truth be told, I did make any sketches or wireframes for my website. I thought I can style it when I work on the HTML at the same time. But I lost my way halfway. I didn’t know what I should do to make it look better so I started to make some sketches. And it started to get better. While working on the website, I have got some problems, but I usually tried my best to solve them. Watch from YouTube or Google and keep trying. For the final version of my website, I felt a sense of accomplishment because I can make my website exactly what I want in the sketches. And I quite enjoy making a website. It is fun and challenging.</p>
